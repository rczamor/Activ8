-- NODE GALLERY SLIDESHOW --

SUMMARY
-------
  The node_gallery_slideshow module extends the Node Gallery module 3.x branch
  with a simple jquery based slideshow. It uses the API of node gallery to retrieve
  images and their related information and is intended to be an easy-to-install
  and integrated solution specifically for node gallery. You don't need to create
  or adapt Views, or download additional jquery libraries. Everything required
  is contained in the project, and the code is small and concise. After enabling
  the module, Gallery nodes will show an additional tab for slideshows, Image nodes
  will contain a link in the Node Gallery navigator to start a slideshow starting
  at this node. Because this module is integrated with Node Gallery, it does
  not require that all images are already attached to the DOM, like most other
  slideshow modules. It retrieves the image information per JSON requests and creates
  and attaches the HTML elements on demand, keeping memory requirements small
  for the client. If desired, the module can preload a specified number of images.
