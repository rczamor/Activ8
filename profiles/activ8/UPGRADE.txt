==============================

* NOTE: VERSION 1.0 of Activ8 is no longer supported. We will also not provide backwards compatability. As of this 1.5 branch, we are taking this distribution in a different direction.

1. Backup both the code and database.

2. Replace your Activ8 codebase, be sure to preserve the files directory.

3. Clear your caches

4. Run any database updates.
